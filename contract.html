	<p>I, 
		<b><em>Emmanuel Sosa</em></b>
		agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my 2018 Fall Web 110_01:Internet/Web Fundamentals with my instructor,Daniel von Briesen.

		I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

	</p>
	<p>
		I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
			<br/><br/>
		Signed:
