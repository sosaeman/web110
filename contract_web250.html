		Emmanuel Sosa Course Contract 
		<br/>Web 250
	</h1>
</header>


<main>
	<p>I, 
		<a href="Introduction.html"><b><em>Emmanuel Sosa</em></b></a>
		agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2021 WEB250_N890:Database Driven Websites with my instructor, DI von Briesen.

I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.

		Signed:
		<em>
		Emmanuel Sosa, 1/22/2021
